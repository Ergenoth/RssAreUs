# RssAreUs

This project aims to provide a solution for RSS Feeds without any existing service such as Readly, Google Currents or any other of these types.
The idea for this project came as I wanted to have an idependent solution for accessing all of my relevant RSS sources.
The mentioned services does always require an account and you are always reliable on their service. There is no possiblity to have the feeds under your control.

Therefore I'm trying to create RssAreUs. The application tries to accomplish the following features:
- Providing a small server part for reading the RSS feeds from the registered pages in a defined intervall
- Providing a small web application for accessing the collected feeds from the registered pages (No app on your smartphone required)
- Further there is the plan to provide a "desktop" application which contains both components (Server/Web application)
- For offline usage of the feeds (when the user does not have the chance to run the server part and web application 24 hours) there will be a PDF export from the unread feeds

With all of these components the user will be able to set up an own system for managing feeds withtout the hassle to have an account for the several services or to be dependent of the service status of these services.

Work is in progress and the project started recently.
I'm trying to contribute as much as possible to this project
